Tutorials
=========


On these tutorials, you will learn how to create a coverage path for a field.
Fields2Cover library is made by several modules.
Each of them solves an individual part of the Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem.
Here, you will learn how to concatenate them to solve the CPP.

.. note::
   This version of the code only supports convex fields.
   However, the software architecture is prepared to be extended to more complex situations.

All the code examples shown in the tutorials are located on the ``tutorials`` folder.

Moreover, tutorials are compiled automatically with the project.
If you want to run the examples, go to your `build` folder and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo chmod a+rwx tutorials/*
    ./tutorials/<name of the tutorial
